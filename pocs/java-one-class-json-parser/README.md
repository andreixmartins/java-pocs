### Lean Json Parser

* No Dependencies
* One class
* 100 lines of code

### Implementation

* Sucks
* Not a real parser
* API sucks

### Inspired by

* https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-program-to-implement-a-json-parser/
However I fixed several bugs, simplify the code and add sanitization and exceptions.

### Build 
```bash
./mvnw clean install 
```
