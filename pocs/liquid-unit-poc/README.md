LiquidUnit Usage:
  No args     - Run complete test suite: migrations, rollbacks, migrations
  --mt        - Run only migration tests
  --ro        - Run only rollback tests
  --? or --h  - Display this help message
```

### Rationale

The idea of this POC is to create a `blend` between `Liquibase` and `Junit`.
So migrations can be executed as tests (`test.sql`) and they can fail and `rollback.sql` script is executed.
So it's possible to automate schema changes and even migrations and be test-driven.

Basically you have 3 files:
* migration.sql -> Where you perform the migration
* test.sql -> Where you perform the tests, `expect : <number>` is used to assert the result of the query. 
* rollback.sql -> Where you perform the rollback.

### Why this POC is useful?

1. You can test migration scrips locally.
2. It can be used as bases for Integration testes with Migration Scripts.
3. It could be the basis for production automation of migration scripts.
4. It's fun and cool to learn stuff :-) Tests are being generated on the fly.

### Result

Migrations and Tests
<img src="result-idea.png" />

Each SQL is run as an assertion and verified. Example:
```
Executing tests from src/main/resources/migrations/migration_1_create_schema/test.sql
Found expectation (look-ahead): 1
✓ Assertion passed: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.schemata WHERE schema_name = 'profile' -> Expected: 1, Actual: 1
Found expectation (look-ahead): 1
✓ Assertion passed: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'profile' AND table_name = 'user' -> Expected: 1, Actual: 1
Found expectation (look-ahead): 1
✓ Assertion passed: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'profile' AND table_name = 'user_links' -> Expected: 1, Actual: 1
Found expectation (look-ahead): 4
✓ Assertion passed: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'profile' AND table_name = 'user' AND column_name IN ('id', 'name', 'email', 'address') -> Expected: 4, Actual: 4
Found expectation (look-ahead): 5
✓ Assertion passed: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'profile' AND table_name = 'user_links' AND column_name IN ('id', 'user_id', 'x_link', 'facebook_link', 'youtube_link') -> Expected: 5, Actual: 5
Found expectation (look-ahead): 1
✓ Assertion passed: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.key_column_usage WHERE table_schema = 'profile' AND table_name = 'user_links' AND column_name = 'user_id' AND referenced_table_name = 'user' -> Expected: 1, Actual: 1
```

Rollbacks
<img src="result-rollback.png" />

Sample output:
```
Applied migration: migration_4_add_data
Tables to verify dropped: []
Schemas to verify dropped: []
Tables to verify empty after DELETE: [profile.user_links, profile.user]
Executed rollback: src/main/resources/migrations/migration_4_add_data/rollback.sql
✓ Table verified empty after DELETE: profile.user_links
✓ Table verified empty after DELETE: profile.user
```

### TODO

1. Add more Patterns
2. Add more tests
3. Improve limitations (accept Strings equals, multiple stmts, multiline comments)

# PLOT TWIST

So far you taught this POC was just about Testing and Databases.
Well it's true, all good things about Database Migration Testing, automation, testing rollbacks, testing being generated, using advanced junit 5 features and liquibase with code all good.
BUT... PLOT TWIST... Well it's also about AI/LLMs.
Read this part now...

### Refactoring Notes

#### V1 (took 4h to get it done)

* 2 classes: 
  * `LiquidUnitTests` - Class that runs the migration and tests
  * `LiquidUnitRollbackTests` - Class that runs the rollback and tests
* Code was duplicated from src/main/java to src/test/java
* Lots of duplications
* Lots of methods throwing exceptions
* DB Config/Reading was duplicated

Summary:
```
LiquidUnitTests : 253 LoC
LiquidUnitRollbackTests : 365 LoC
```

Original Code: https://github.com/diegopacheco/java-pocs/tree/before-liquidunit-refactoring/pocs/liquid-unit-poc/src/main/java/com/github/diegopacheco/liquidunit

#### 🏁 V1 Method Summary

V1: Method using Copilot/Sonnet 3.7 LLM in a `Vibe Code` it could not be 100% vibe code because AI got stuck several times and could not troubleshoot problems and would get stuck forever on same point so consider 80% vibe code.

#### V2 (took 3h to get it done)

* No more code duplication
* Tests are the source of truth at : LiquidUnitRollbackTests and LiquidUnitTests Tests now extend this both classes and do nothing.
* Remove throws Exception
* DB Config/Reading is abstracted and centralized by the DAO
* Better separation of concerns
* Using Java Records :-)
* Created the following concerns:
  * DAO: `DatabaseDAO` - Class that handles all the database operations
  * Liquibase: `LiquibaseService` - Class that handles all the liquibase operations
  * Parser: `SQLTestsParser` - Class that handles all the SQL parsing operations for SQL test Assertions
  * Parser:  `SQLRollbackParser` - Class that handles all the SQL parsing operations for SQL Rollback Test Generations
  * Execution.Engine: `LiquidUnitTests` - Class that handles the execution of the migrations and tests
  * Execution.Engine: `LiquidUnitRollbackTests` - Class that handles the execution of the rollbacks and generated tests
* Test the Code that generate and run tests: 
  * 11 Unit Tests for the `SQLTestsParser` code
  * 11 Unit Tests for the `SQLRollbackParser` code
  * 9 Integration Tests for `DatabaseMigrationDAO` code
  * 4 Unit Tests (with mocks sorry) for the `LiquibaseService` code
* Total 45 tests

Summary:
```
LiquidUnitTests : 88 LoC (65% less code) 
LiquidUnitRollbackTests : 159 LoC (56% less code)
```
<BR/>

Note on Order: 
Usually `@Order` is a bad thing, I would not do this if was not a POC
because make the tests more fragile, here it would be better split this project in more projects
them it would be easier to do something's and have parallelism and isolation.

#### 🏁 V2 Method Summary

V2: Method here was NO AI LLM for the Refactoring, only use AI to help with tests of the tests. That part was smooth and pretty good.

### Summary on AI LLM Experiment

Took me 4h to get it working and 3h to fix it to make it "decent". So LLM is not linear improvement it's useful but far from perfect and good to prototype and get something working but still need spend almost same amount of code to Refactor and make it decent.
LLM/Copilot is created to start something and an idea out to do some `Discovery` and `Prototyping` but not to finish a project in a scalable and proper way.
It really struggled and cannot create decent structure that scale, that a human need to do. The "Vibe Code" generate is full of problems and took a lot of time to fix and put in a proper structure and make less bad.
Also need to call out that sucks troubleshooting and debug problems.

What LLM are good:
* Autocomplete
* Migrations
* Generating Tests
 
What LLM Suck:
* Generate Scalable code with proper Design and Architecture
* Troubleshooting and Debugging problems

Again if we dont know what we doing how we will know someone is lying to us? How do we know AI is producing good code? Only if we do better we must RAISE THE BAR.

### Plot Twist (Again)

<img src="surprised-pikachu.gif" />

So I did a V3 Method using AI to refactor the code.
I asked AI(Github Copilot using Sonnet 3.7) to refactor the code.
Here is what AI did <BR/>
https://github.com/diegopacheco/java-pocs/tree/ai-refactored-liquidunit/pocs/liquid-unit-poc

### AI Refactoring Summary

🖹 Prompt
```
could you refactor this file and create proper structure, proper architecture and design,
make sure you do your best and make sure the structure is scalable and proper for decent
software engineering to mantain it over time. Do it for: LiquidUnitTests and LiquidUnitRollbackTests
```

Diego Pacheco Architecture/Design Review - Feedback on AI Refactor:

PROS

1. Great AI did all that in `15min`, the slow part of me copying the code.
2. Good news the build pass when I run `mvn clean install`

CONS

1. At a "Glance" looks good, there is structure, multiple classes, but just in the surface, the design and architecture is pretty bad.
2. I see AI created a class to extend the Tests and remove duplication between code/tests 
however just for 1 file `LiquidUnitTests`  - AI completely miss the other file which is `LiquidUnitRollbackTests`.
3. The most naive thing is that I had a main class and ai did not even touch it, so is my code that still running
AI did all this refactoring but ai code is not being called because is my old main class still (face plan).
4. The names of packages suck. `core` has nothing that is core, it has configs and database access code.
5. There is a package named `junit` which sucks because this is not junit this is an execution engine that uses junit, AI got this wrong.
6. There is a folder called `migrations` that one is not that bad, as name make sense.
7. There is another one called `cli` which has the main method there and that's not obvious. Maven will not read from there, AI did not told me to change my pom.xml
in Fact like I said, AI completely ignore the Main class I had and that still active. 
8. DatabaseConnector does very little, that class is very weak. AI never mentioned anything about connection pool or proper connection management in fact AI original code still uses DriverManager which sucks. 
9. LiquidUnitConfig has security anti-patterns, it has the `password` in clear text hardcoded in `2 places`.
10. LiquidUnitRollbackTests is not bad. This one good job.
11. LiquidUnitTests is not bad as well. This one good job.
12. MigrationExecutor AI is doing imports that are never use, this is wrong.
13. MigrationExecutor has database access code, AI is not doing proper SOC(Separation of Concerns) here. Wrong and BAD!
14. MigrationExecutor uses `FileSystemResourceAccessor` which is deprecated, wrong, AI did not even botter to update it.
15. MigrationExecutor AI did not get rid of all duplicated code, and methods pass parameters that are not necessary.
16. MigrationExecutor AI is doing `currentQuery.length() > 0` where it should be `!currentQuery.isEmpty()`
17. MigrationExecutor AI is doing lots of necessary else statements, code should be simplified AI did not simplify the code.
18. MigrationExecutor has SQL and DAO code here, and it should not be here again SOC.
19. LiquidUnitConfig is completely wrong, this class is not necessary, only DAO need this information.
20. DatabaseConnector is not even a proper Singleton, does not even properly prevent multiple connections to be opened.
21. CLI class has a `initilize` method that is not necessary, this should be removed. This is CORBA? Come on AI this is not even proper OOP. Objects have this little thing called constructors. 
22. NO Unit Tests - Where is Tests fot the Code AI?
22. No Integration Tests - Where is Tests fot the Code AI?
23. Overall is pretty bad - I would need spend hours again to fix this and make it decent. 

You're probably thinking, OH but what if you do a different prompt, or what if you give more instructions. Well
we need acknowledge that is the `Human` telling all these things to AI, and if we don't tell, AI won't know and won't do for us.
IF the human does not KNOW all these things, AI will fool you, that's why we need to do better.
Remember this is a lot of things going on like this (All over SV):

Maybe is time to value people, and do better, prove our value again.
